# Human-Pose-Estimation-using-Machine-Learning
This project detects and analyzes human poses using machine learning by identifying key body points like the head, shoulders, and knees. It works with images and videos, visualizing poses as a stick figure. Perfect for fitness tracking, sports analysis, or interactive applications, itâ€™s a simple yet powerful way to explore pose estimation!
