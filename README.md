# Human-Pose-Estimation-using-Machine-Learning
This project detects and analyzes human poses using machine learning by identifying key body points like the head, shoulders, and knees. It works with images and videos, visualizing poses as a stick figure. Perfect for fitness tracking, sports analysis, or interactive applications, it’s a simple yet powerful way to explore pose estimation!

This project focuses on detecting and analyzing human body poses using machine learning, a fascinating field where machines learn to recognize and understand how people move. By identifying key points on the human body—such as the head, shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees—the system creates a “stick figure” representation overlaid on images or videos.

The project uses machine learning models, like Mediapipe, to process visual data and detect these landmarks accurately. It works with both static images and real-time video streams, making it versatile for various applications. For instance, it can track movements during fitness routines, analyze sports performances, assist in physical therapy, or even power gesture-based gaming.

The magic begins when you provide an input, such as a photo or a video. The model processes the visual data, detects the body’s key points, and maps them to a skeletal structure, showing how the person is positioned. For real-time video, the system tracks movements dynamically, making it possible to monitor activities like dancing or yoga.

This project is simple yet powerful, leveraging tools like OpenCV for image processing and Mediapipe for pose detection. The goal is to offer an intuitive, visual way to understand human poses, whether you’re building an AI-powered fitness app, experimenting with gesture recognition, or just curious about how machines interpret the human body.

With this, you can bring innovative ideas to life—tracking movement, analyzing physical performance, or creating interactive systems—all while exploring the exciting world of human pose estimation! Whether you're a beginner or an expert, this project is designed to be a fun, practical starting point for understanding pose estimation through machine learning.
